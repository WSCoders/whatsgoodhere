A CMS for small local restaurants

A lot of restaurant sites are pretty terrible.

  * Overly flashy and slow loading with little informative content
  * Menu's are static image files or pdf's that take a long time to load and can't be updated
  * Doesn't display well on the one place most people are likely to check out a restaurant before going there, a 
    mobile device.
  
This CMS aims to fix that but having a simple way of managing content, dynamically updated menu's, possibly even making 
reservations and look good whether in a web browser on a PC or on a phone.
